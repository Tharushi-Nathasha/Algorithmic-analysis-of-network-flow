# Network Flow Analysis â€“ Max Flow Algorithm (Java)

This project implements the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** using **BFS (Edmonds-Karp)** to solve the **maximum flow problem** in a directed graph. It was developed as part of the **Algorithms coursework (5SENG003W)** at the **University of Westminster**.

## ğŸ§  Features

- Java-based flow network representation using adjacency lists
- Residual edge handling and flow augmentation
- Input file parser for graph configuration
- Step-by-step console output of flow updates
- Final report showing total maximum flow and per-edge flow

---

## ğŸ“‚ Input File Format (`input.txt`)

- The first line is the number of nodes.
- Each following line represents an edge: `from to capacity`

---

## ğŸš€ Run Instructions

1. Place `input.txt` in the root directory of the project.
2. Compile and run:

```bash
javac NetworkFlowApp.java
java NetworkFlowApp
Flow increased by: 4, Total flow: 4
Flow increased by: 4, Total flow: 8
Maximum Flow: 8

Final Flow in Network:
Edge(0 -> 1 | flow: 4 / 6)
Edge(0 -> 2 | flow: 4 / 4)
